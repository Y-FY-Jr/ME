Paper: [ME: Trigger Element Combination Backdoor Attack on Copyright Infringement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10776)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

We proposed Multi-Element (ME) attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain the stealthiness.
